        <p>In an advertising strategy course in college, I was tasked with designing a campaign for Chapstick
        with a team of three. We were to perform all aspects of the advertising strategy:
        Research, strategy, design, and presentation. These are the final prints, copy and design by myself.</p>

        <p>“There is only one Chapstick” was the guideline we were given from the ‘client.’ With research through
        surveys we found that Chapstick met all of the criteria for “satisfactory lip balm,” although many people
        were still buying other brands. We decided to remind consumers that Chapstick is the original. It’s cool,
        sleek, and classic. We also came up with a social media strategy, using primarily Instagram, with the hastag:
        #ChapStickAroundThe World</p>
